# SongWeb
CS 225 Optional Project -

This project uses Spotify's API to measure popularity-similarity overlap between songs in a playlist. Data retrieval was done in Python using the spotipy library. Commit history may not have been carried over so to state solely my contributions, I coded:

*Entire Unweighted BFS Algorithm

*Entire Betweenness Centrality Algorithm

*Roughly half of the test cases, mostly for the stuff I wrote

Everything else was designed by others and for those I receive no credit.

More info is available in the project folder, which contains a full write-up that was used for project submission purposes.
