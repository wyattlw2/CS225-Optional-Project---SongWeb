# SongWeb
CS 225 Optional Project -

This project uses Spotify's API to measure popularity-similarity overlap between songs in a playlist. Data retrieval was done in Python using the spotipy library. Commit history may not have been carried over so to state solely my contributions, I coded:

** Entire Unweighted BFS Algorithm

** Entire Betweenness Centrality Algorithm

** Roughly half of the test cases, mostly for the stuff I wrote

** Very minor contributions to Graph data structure

Everything else was designed by others(*) and for those I receive no credit. More info is available in the project folder, which contains a full write-up that was used for project submission purposes.

(*)The file_to_V2D function was a function made for in-class assignments that was used due to its immediate availability for parsing data.
